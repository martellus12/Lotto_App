# Lotto_App
This program generates numbers and also gets historical numbers for MegaMillions and PowerBall games.
It uses the following Python modules:

Tkinter   (must be imported using PIP)

requests  (part of the standard library)

random    (part of the standard library)

The gui was created using Tkinter and the program makes use of the random module to generate lotto numbers.  
The historical data is drawn from a New York State lottery database, which is public and

Have fun using it and Good Luck!
